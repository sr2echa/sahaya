# <samp>Sahaya : Bridging Help in Crisis</samp>
Sahaya is an innovative disaster relief app designed to strengthen community resilience in the face of climate crises. This user-friendly platform bridges the gap between those in need of essentials and those willing to offer help during natural disasters. It's not just a tool for NGOs and emergency responders; it empowers every individual to be a part of a larger community support system. With Sahaya, preparedness, quick response, and community collaboration become the pillars of effective disaster management.
