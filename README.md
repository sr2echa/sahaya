  We Conducted 2 Survays - to understand the market & other to get app feedback from users

  We did a market **analysis** consisting of more than **1700+ respondents** across **11+ countries** and various backgrounds. Dispite the diverse set of people, most of them wanted a community powered platform for disaster management. 
  
  Then we conducted a **feedback** survey involving more than **600+** closed beta testers (friends & family) who shared their experiece and rated the app's features.
